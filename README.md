# SQLite3 Learning Repository

## Purpose

This repository was created for learning and practicing SQLite3 database operations. It serves as a personal reference for revisiting SQLite concepts and implementations in the future.

## Contents

### Notebooks
- **`sqlite.ipynb`** - Main Jupyter notebook with SQLite3 examples and experiments
- **`Module_SQLite3_Assignments_Questions.ipynb`** - Assignment questions for practicing SQLite3 concepts
- **`Module_SQLite3_Assignments_Solution.ipynb`** - Complete solutions to the assignment questions

### Backend Utilities
- **`BackendUtilities/`** - Backend utility modules and scripts
  - **`app.py`** - Backend application script
  - **`logging.ipynb`** - Logging implementation notebook
  - **`multiplelogger.ipynb`** - Multiple logger configuration examples
  - **`logs/`** - Logging module directory
    - **`logger.py`** - Logger implementation
    - **`test.py`** - Test script for logging functionality

### Database Files
- **`example.db`** - Example SQLite database
- **`saleData.db`** - Sales data database for practice
- **`test.db`** - Test database
- **`backup.db`** - Backup database

## How to Use

1. Start with `sqlite.ipynb` to learn basic SQLite3 operations
2. Practice with assignments in `Module_SQLite3_Assignments_Questions.ipynb`
3. Check your solutions against `Module_SQLite3_Assignments_Solution.ipynb`
4. Explore backend utilities and logging implementations in `BackendUtilities/`

## Notes

This is a learning project intended for personal knowledge building and future revision.
